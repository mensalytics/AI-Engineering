GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM NOTES FOR DATA ENGINEERING and Machine Learning 

1. UNDERSTANDING CLOUD 
some history on cloud computing and computer 
your laptop has CPU, RAM, HARD DISK, network interface card connecting to relevant internet service provider 
Google cloud offers COMPUTE ENGINE. 
can build self managed virtual machines in Google Cloud. 


MANAGING RESOURCES IN GOOGLE CLOUUD 
You can use Google cloud shell to manage all resources in google cloud platform 
Tools provided to manage resources in the command line is 
a. gsutil => GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE SERVICES 
b. bq => bigquery services 
c. kubectl => kubernetes services 


GCP NETWORKING 
without networking, computer cannot connect to the outside world and you will not enjoy the things you enjoy now. 
with GCP, a cloud network called VPC(VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD) is used. 
This is a software based logical network resource 
within a GCP project a number of these VPCs can be provisioned 
After launching VMs,  you can connect them within a VPC or isolate them from each other in seperate VPCs 
VPCs are global, so can be provisioned anywhere in the world. 
within a VPC is a public subnet which has VMs with external IP addresses that are accessible from the internet and can access the internet 
private subnets contain VMs that do not have external IP Addresses. 
VPCs can be peered with each other within a GCP project or outside a GCP project. 

2. HOW TO CREATE FIRST GCP PROJECT 
Each GCP project has a PROJECT NAME AND PROJECT ID. 
This is a default project name and when you spin up your own GCP, you will see a different default project name 
You can then make your customised project. 
PROJECT NAME => My First Project
PROJECT ID => calm-athlete-375514
3. USING THE CLOUD SHELL
The cloud shell is like the terminal you use on your favorite coding editor 
You can open editor in Google cloud, create a program and run it in google cloud platform. 

4. VM BASED VS MANAGED SERVICES VS SERVERLESS SERVICES 
Before we delive into this. The goal is to use products that are configured and maintained by service provider(GOOGLE). 
There are three approaches to using managed services in google cloud platform 
1. VM BASED 2. MANAGED SERVICES 3. SERVERLESS(FULLY MANAGED SERVICES) 
VM BASES => VIRTUAL MACHINE which is compute engine. You need to install software yourself. 
This is a viable option because not all softwares are install in Google Cloud Platform. 

2. Managed Services: This means google manages the software for you. No need to install an OS. 
A typical example is if i wanted to use hadoop in gcp. i need to spin up a VM 
Install Hadoop and then use it. 
The hadoop alternative which is a managed service is Dataproc. No installations needed and google manages everything 
for you. But as a user, you might still need to configure the machine size, networks etc 

3. SERVERLESS: Means simply use it. ie Bigquery. You do not need to set up anything 
so in conclusion the main differences between these are 
VM BASED You manage virtual machines, applications and develop whatever service you want. 
MANAGED SERVICE, You manage applications and develop the service you want. 
FULLY MANAGED SERVICE, you just develop the service you want. 

SCENARIOS 
AS A DATA ENGINEER, i want to process and store csv data 

solution 1: 
a. provision multiple vm instances in gcp using compute engine 
configure the vm networks, os, packages and any infrastructures necessary. 
b. install hadoop cluster on top of the compute engine instances. 
choose any hadoop version you like 
c. store data in HDFS and create a hive table on top of the cluster 

solution 2: 
a. spin up and enable dataproc 
b. store data in hdfs and create a hive table on top of the hadoop cluster 

solution 3: 
a. store the data in bigquery which is a fully managed service for data warehouse. 



5. GOOGLE CLOUD ANALYTICS TOOLS 
We will be focusing on analytics and machine learning tools. 
Google Cloud Big data ana analytics services are 
a. Cloud Dataproc 
This is built on the concept of Map-Reduce and Hadoop systems architecture. 
This is a managed GCP service for processing large datasets. 
Organisations can provision clusters of varying sizes. 
It can be used to process, transform and understand large quantities of data. 
It can be used to run apache spark, flink, presto etc 
It can also be used for data lake mordinzation, etl processes and etc 
b. Cloud dataflow 
This is also a managed service for developing and executing a wide variety of data processing tasks ie ETL batch and streaming jobs. 
This is a serverless service that runs jobs written in apache beam. There is a sequence of steps for reading, transforming and writing out data. 
Pipeline consists of a series of steps, which is a way to connect compoenents to next step. 
When jobs are executed, dataflow spins up a cluster of VMs, distributes the job tasks to the VMs and scales the cluster based on the job loads and performance. 
c. BigQuery 
This an enterprise datawarehouse service which is scalable, fast and optimised for data analytics. 
1. it supports standard sql queries. 
2. It is serverless. 
3. It integrates well with other GCP services. 
4. Manage and analyse your data with built in ML, geo spatial analysis and BI. 
d. Cloud Pub/sub 
This implements an event/message queue pipe to integrate services and parallelise tasks. 
With pub/sub service, you can create event producers(publishers) and consumers called subscribers. 
ie After an object is uploaded into Google cloud storage bucket, 
a request can be generated and sent to PUB/SUB which can trigger an email notification and cloud function to process the object. 
e. Datastream 
This is a serverless data replication service. This allows to easily replicate data from relational databases ie oracle into bigquery directly. 
It supports streaming changes from oracle, mysql, postgressql databases into cloud storage. 
It also offers streamlined integration by using dataflow templates to build custom workflows to replicate databases into cloud sql or cloud spanner for database synchronisation. 
f. Dataplex 
There are datawarehouses, datalakes and data marts. 
This is a unified data management tool to automate data management. 
enables organisations to centrally discover, manage, monitor and govern data accross data lakes, data warehouses and data marts. 

g. Looker 
Business intelligence tool for data analytics. Helps explore, share and visualise organisations data to make better business decisions. 
You can use looker to build dashboards for your business. 
i. Dataprep 
This is a data preprocessing tool for exploring, cleaning and preparing structured or unstructured data for analysis, reporting and machine learning. 
j. Data fusion 
This is a fully managed visual click interface for creating and deploying ETL/ELT data pipelines. 
This is an alternative no code data integeration service. 
You can move data from onpremise to cloud using this tool. 
k. Cloud Composer 
This is a fully managed workflow orchestration service, enabling to create,schedule and manage workflows that span accross cloud and on premise data. 
This is built on popular apache airflow and will be investigated in depth and operates using python programming language. 



COMPUTE SERVICES IN GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM 
The whole GCP compute tools are 
1. Google Compute Engine 
Images provide the base operating environment for apps that run in compute engine(VMs) 
GCE offers different pricing models. ie Pay as you model, committed usage, premptive and sole tenant host. 
Pay as you go is for businesses that need provision on the fly 
if workload is foreseeable, then we use committed usage
if the workload can be restarted then we want to leverage the premptive model
